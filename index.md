Hello, I am Jennifer. I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in Math-CS in UC San Diego. I am interested in cryptography and network systems.

### ![](https://i.imgur.com/TgakUPf.png) Programming Knowledge 
I have programmed in various languages, with some being used more than others.
The languages, listed from my most experienced to least:
1. C/C++
2. Java

As I am the most knowledgable about C, I shall provide my ***favorite code***:
```
printf("Hello, World!");
```

### :cowboy_hat_face: Fun Stuff
As mentioned previously, I enjoy playing video games in my free time.
Here's a list of my **favorite** games:
- 100% Orange Juice
- Maplestory
- Yakuza Series
- Bloons TD 6

I also read manga and watch anime such as:
- [*Shaman King*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaman_King)
- [*Mieruko-chan*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mieruko-chan)

I am always down for suggestions, especially if they are in the horror genre.

Additionally, I also enjoy drawing and image editing.

I had previously worked on a Yearbook team in which I took photos and edited them. My favorite project was reconstructing hands on an individual in a group photo as they made strange gestures in the photo we had taken. One may ask:
> Why didn't you retake the photo?
As for the answer to that, we were unable to gather the people in the group photo again due to scheduling issues.

Thank you for reading my page! Have a bee.
